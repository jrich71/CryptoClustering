# ðŸ§  Cryptocurrency Clustering with K-Means and PCA

This project performs unsupervised learning on cryptocurrency market data to explore how similar coins behave based on price changes. It uses both **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and clustering optimization.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Data Source

- Dataset: `Resources/crypto_market_data.csv`
- Each row represents a cryptocurrency.
- Columns represent price change percentages over various periods.

---

## ðŸ”§ Libraries Used

```python
pandas, sklearn (KMeans, PCA, StandardScaler), matplotlib
```

---

## ðŸ”„ Data Preprocessing

- Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
- Preserved original coin identifiers via DataFrame index.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Elbow Method to Find Best k (Original Data)

Used the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using **KMeans on scaled data**.

> **Best k = 4**

## ðŸ”· KMeans Clustering (Original Data)

Visualized clusters based on 24h and 7d price change percentages:

---

## ðŸ“‰ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduced data to **3 principal components** capturing ~89.5% of the variance.

> **Explained Variance (PCA1â€“3):** ~89.5%

---

## ðŸ“Š Elbow Method to Find Best k (PCA Data)

Identified optimal k again after dimensionality reduction with PCA:

> **Best k = 4** â€” same as original data.

## ðŸŒˆ KMeans Clustering (PCA Data)

Visualized crypto clusters using PCA-reduced data:

## ðŸ“Œ Feature Importance from PCA

Features with the strongest impact on each principal component:

- **PCA1**
  - Positive: `price_change_percentage_200d` (.5944)
  - Negative: `price_change_percentage_24h` (-0.4167)
- **PCA2**
  - Positive: `price_change_percentage_30d` (.5621)
  - Negative: `price_change_percentage_1y` (-0.1508)
- **PCA3**
  - Positive: `price_change_percentage_14d` (.3495)
  - Negative: `price_change_percentage_60d` (-0.3613)

---

## âœ… Conclusion

- Both **KMeans** and **PCA** suggest 4 distinct crypto behavior clusters.
- PCA effectively preserves data structure while reducing dimensions.
- Visual clustering helps interpret crypto groupings based on price volatility.
